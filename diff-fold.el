;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A minor mode that allows hiding and showing hunks and files in a
;; diff-mode buffer.
;;
;; To install add it to your elisp path,
;;   (require diff-fold)
;; then turn it on for all diff buffers with:
;;   (add-hook 'diff-mode-hook 'turn-on-diff-fold)
;;
;; By default, the minor mode binds hiding/showing behavior to TAB
;; and shift-TAB in `diff-fold-mode-map`.
;;
;; If you use diff-mode in read-only mode, with
;; `diff-default-read-only` set to t, you'll want to add your own
;; shortcuts directly to `diff-mode-shared-map`, for
;;
;; Under Emacs 27, diff-fold plays well with `diff-font-lock-prettify`.
;;
;; Setup example, with use-package and straight:
;;
;; (use-package diff-mode
;;   :hook ((diff-mode . turn-on-diff-fold)))
;;
;; (use-package diff-fold
;;   :straight (:type git :repo "https://github.com/szermatt/diff-fold.git")
;;   :bind (:map diff-mode-shared-map
;;               ("H" . diff-fold-hide-all-files)
;;               ("h" . diff-fold-toggle)
;;               ("S" . diff-fold-show-all)
;;               ("TAB" . diff-fold-toggle)
;;               ("S-TAB" . diff-fold-toggle-file)
;;               ("<backtab>" . diff-fold-toggle-file)))
